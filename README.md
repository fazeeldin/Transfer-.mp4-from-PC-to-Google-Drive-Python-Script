# Transfer-.mp4-from-PC-to-Google-Drive-Python-Script
## Inspiration:

I am an online trainer. I record the live session for my student's future rerference on zoom meeting. For every meeting, 
a folder is created with a specific naming convention in my documents/zoom folder

Source File Name Convention: DATE TIME NAME_OF_THE_MEETING MEETING_ID.

I have to upload these files on Google Drive every day after the class is complete. The file needs to be uploaded in the folder. 
The name of the folder should be the NAME_OF_THE_MEETING (Refer above). The name of the file in the drive has a specific naming 
convention too.

Destination File Name Convention: NAME_OF_THE_MEETING DATE PART_i, where i value ranges between 0 to as many .mp4 files as there are in
the input source folder.
